# Summary

My first attempt at 3D designs, following a full size BB8 build I thought I'd tackle R2D2. Here's a full size Dome (Work in progress). The lower and upper rings have holes for alignment which 1.75 filament can be used in on the edge to edge gaps. Top pie pieces have removable supports. All is designed for ABS to minimise shrinkage and warping. 28/5 added a board bracket (to be glued inside the dome), fits a Ardunio and an adafruit 16 channel servo controller along with a 12v - 5v dc convertor (the one's used in cars) as I'm using a 11.1v lipo battery. Video of completed dome.. https://youtu.be/46cj6XR9Y64.

Just enabled tips to see what happens... Please feel free to send across a tiny tiny amount if you wish to! Not even sure if it works as I can't see anything on my screen :-). Here's a link to a superb build video by MightyJabba, great sdemonstration of the build and a beautiful finished model https://youtu.be/3WcUO5BmH0w Revised Radar Eye for accuracy (version2). Another brilliant build video from Trevor Fuller, check it out for reference. First thing Trevor has printed! https://youtu.be/KQ6VAYtlbDg
